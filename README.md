## üîç Quality Comparison

Here you can see a comparison between the original image and the enhanced image using the **IRCNN_Mx1_fp16** model.

| Original Image                        | Enhanced Image (IRCNN_Mx1_fp16)        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ![Original](Assets/OriginalImage.png) | ![Enhanced](Assets/UpscalerImage.png) |

The image on the left is the original, and the one on the right is the same image enhanced using the **Real-ESRGANx4** model, improving the quality and resolution while maintaining sharp details and reducing visible noise.
