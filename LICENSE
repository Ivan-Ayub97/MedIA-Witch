### **Technologies and Libraries Used in MedIA-Witch:**

**MedIA-Witch** is based on **[QualityScaler](https://github.com/Djdefrag/QualityScaler.git)**, an advanced platform for enhancing images and videos using AI models. It also integrates several open-source technologies to enhance its functionality:

- **[QualityScaler](https://github.com/Djdefrag/QualityScaler.git)** – The foundation of MedIA-Witch, implementing AI models such as Real-ESRGAN, SRGAN, BSRGAN, and IRCNN_Mx1_fp16.
- **[Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)** – AI model for image resolution enhancement.
- **[SRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802)** – Generative adversarial network for super-resolution.
- **[BSRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05324)** – Generative adversarial network for super-resolution in degraded images.
- **[IRCNN](https://github.com/lipengFu/IRCNN.git)** – AI model for noise reduction and image enhancement using convolutional neural networks.
- **[ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/)** – Optimized execution engine for deep learning models.
- **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** – Multimedia framework for processing images and videos.
- **[PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)** – Tool for packaging MedIA-Witch into an executable file.
- **[Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)** – Used for creating the MedIA-Witch installer.
